# Login Page

This is a simple login page with basic styling and validation messages for email and password fields. I created this to practice my html and css skills, and I feel like I will someday have to create a login page.

## Demo

- Responsive full-screen background image.
- Login form with email and password input fields.
- Success and error messages for form validation.
- Styled with custom CSS using variables for colors.
